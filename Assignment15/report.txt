with javascript runtime environment javascript can be run anywhere for eg: robots,smart watches, smart phone etc.
javascript runtime environment consists JS engine,APIs and eventloops and queues.
JS Engine is the heart of the JSRE.
Browser and Node.JS has JSRE.
Just In Time compilation in JS Engine can be Interpretter language or Compiler language

JS Engine: 
list of JS Engine:
1. Chakra (Microsoft)
2. SpiderMonkey (Firefox)
3. V8 (Google Chrome) (Node.JS)

JS Engine Architecture:
code(input) -> parsing -> compilation -> Execution
 
 Parsing - code is broken down into tokens
Syntax Parser - converts token into AST(Abstract Syntax Tree)
compilation and Execution goes hand in hand- Interpretter converts into bytecode and sends it to Execution

Garbage Collector - clears space and it uses Mark & Sweep Algorithm

Google v8 engine is the Fastest JS engine 
Ignition is the V8's Interpretter and TurboFan is the Compiler
Orinoco and oilpan are the Garbage Collectors.
