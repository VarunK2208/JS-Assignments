HOW CODE IS EXECUTED
variables n , m and function sum and sum1 is stored in memory in the 1st phase .
in the 2nd phase values are assigned to the variables and it invokes the function (function invoking is done in line 8)

WORKING OF CALL STACK
when the GEC(GLOBAL EXECUTION CONTEXT) is pushed inside the stack
in the code if function is being invoked, the function is pushed inside this stack and when the function is executed it is popped out and the control/returns to GEC.
similarly it happens with all the functions.
